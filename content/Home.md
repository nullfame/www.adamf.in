## Work / Technology

By day I lead the development team at CardX in downtown Chicago.  Our company provides zero-cost credit card processing to merchants by applying a surcharge to cover the cost of acceptance.  We are cloud native, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), and I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect (2017-2023).  We follow the serverless and microservce paradigms so the vast majority of our infrastructure is stand-alone Lambda functions.  Our language of choice is JavaScript using Node.js on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend.  Beyond code itself I believe testing, logging, and documentation are first-class citizens in the development world.  Together they form a triforce of excellence.

Prior to joining CardX I spent seventeen years at Northwestern University, most of that in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, where I managed various web technology initiatives.

## Community

I moved to Evanston in 2001 and have stayed involved in the community.  Most notably I was a founding member of the Grandmother Park Initiative which raised $250,000 to build a park and donate it to the City.  I volunteered in a number of political campaigns and served as president of the Democratic Party of Evanston.  I am a graduate of Leadership Evanston where I worked on an affordable housing project.  I am a board member of the Grandmother Park Fund managed by the Evanston Community Foundation.

## Hobbies

I like to cook.  I describe my cooking as “simple food done well,” drawing a lot from the American south and southwest.  During block party I usually barbecue ribs or a brisket.  I listen to podcasts about current events, technology, and politics.  My musical preferences are classic rock, hip hop,  and recommendations from Flow State.  I know my way around a sewing machine.  I believe that relative to twelve, ten is grossly overrated.

## Background

I was born in Dearborn, Michigan, a border suburb of Detroit, and lived there until I was 13.  I then moved to the north side of Chicago (Ravenswood / Lincoln Square) and graduated from Amundsen High School.  After that I attended Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa where I studied mathematics and computer science.
