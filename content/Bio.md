Cloud developer who once mapped the maze of twisty little passages all alike. Verbs: build, empower, connect.

By day I am a senior developer at CardX in downtown Chicago. We are a payment card processor focused on zero-cost credit card transactions. My work focuses on developing our next-generation online portal and associated APIs using Node.js and Vue.js in the Amazon Web Services ecosystem, particularly focused on serverless infrastructure. I hold associate certifications as both an AWS solutions architect and a developer. Prior to joining CardX I spent seventeen years at Northwestern University managing application development and other technology projects.

I'm originally from Dearborn, Michigan and later moved to Chicago where I attended Amundsen High School. I studied mathematics and computer science at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa before moving to Evanston in 2001. I'm a graduate of Leadership Evanston (2006) and highly recommend it.

I put my curly braces on the right line. I mapped the maze of twisty little passages all alike. If I had to explain Unix in 140 characters or less I would say less is more, more is less, and cat is awesome because it has a funny name. I bike to work when the weather is nice. I have a kite in my office. I believe that relative to twelve ten is grossly overrated. I believe w=uh. I tpye god. INTJ.
